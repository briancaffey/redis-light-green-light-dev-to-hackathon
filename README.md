### Performance Benchmarks

[If you migrated an existing app to use Redis, please put performance benchmarks here to show the performance improvements.]

## How to run it locally?

[Make sure you test this with a fresh clone of your repo, these instructions will be used to judge your app.]

Run the backend:

```
gunicorn -k geventwebsocket.gunicorn.workers.GeventWebSocketWorker -w 1 app:app
```
